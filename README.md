## About the Video Course
Java developers face many challenges such as managing data streams and increasing responsiveness and performance for their applications. This course will help you overcome these challenges in just seven steps. 
This course will teach you the new programming paradigms of RxJava in just seven steps by building an e-commerce application. Each section will cover approximately 30 minutes of core hands-on training on reactive programming, followed by a practical assignment. You will work with functional programming, transformations, concurrency, error handling, and much more with reactive programming. 
By the end of this course, you'll be proficient in using reactive principles to write high-performance and efficient event-based applications using asynchronous data streams with Java.
